# Problem Statement for Hackathon

## Programming tracks (Round 1 - 20 Marks)

### Return the "centered" average of an array of integers.
- If negative integer values are there ignore it.
- If multiple duplicate values are present then consider only one value and ignore rest values.
> Sample Input: First line takes number of elements in array, Second line takes input those elements which are seperated by space.
> Sample Output: Leave first and last element and compute the mean of rest elements satisfying condition a and b respectively.
> Sample Inputs  - 7 and [1,2,-3,4,4,3,100]   And  output: 3 
> Sample Inputs  - 13 and [-10,-4,2,3,6,6,-16,4,3,4,3,10,-20] output: 13/3 = 4.333 

- Our Approach for solution of this problem : Python programming and NumPY

## Case Based Problems (Round 2 - 30 Marks)
Blood bank finder: Suppose we have some blood banks registered in data bases with following entries (Blood types no of samples). Anyone Can request and cancel no. of blood sample from any place to these banks. Suppose person A From Phagawara book 1 sample of B+ from Jalandhar model town blood bank and start to get these samples, mean while during 30 mints. Another person B take these sample due to urgency so software directly give suggestion/route to nearest bank from their current location.

- Our Approach for solution of this problem : PhP (backend), MySql (DB), GeoCoder (For getting geolocation), Matrix API

## Real Life Software Development Challenges (Round 3 - 50 Marks)
Develope a Voice to Text Recognition system.
Whenever user will say something system should identify those words and it should be printed on screen

- Our Approach for solution of this problem : Javascript, Jquery, WebKit Speech 

We developed some cool things with this during our hackathon. It was something like whenever you will say "Hello" System will say "Hello, Sir how are you"
"Whats the time?" System will say "Its 10:01 Pm"
